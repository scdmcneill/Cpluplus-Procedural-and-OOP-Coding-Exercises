# CS 2411 Coding Exercises
This project contains solutions to coding problems posed by my **Object-Oriented class with C++**. I created this repository primarily to help classmates of mine understand and see solutions to coding problems. 
Each ".cpp" file represents an **individual coding problem**, and includes a header comment describing the **prompt**, **objective**, and **concepts demonstrated**.

## Overview
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical applications of:
- **C++ fundamentals**: variables, loops, functions, arrays, pointers
- **Object-oriented principles**: classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Problem Solving Strategies**: algorithm design, data structure, logical reasoning
- **Code Organization and Readability**: modular design, inline documentation, consistent formating

This serves as a **personal archive of C++ practice problems** and a way to track progress through the course

## Learning Objectives
Through these exercises, I aim to strengthen understanding of:
- The core syntax and semantics of C++
- How objects interact and how memory is managed
- Applying abstract thinking and encapsulation to solve real-world problems
- writing clean, reusable, and maintainable C++ code
